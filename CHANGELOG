CERE CHANGELOG

[v0.3.1] 2018/11/30
    * Maintainance release, ensure all checks are passing with newer travis images

[v0.3] 2017/10/12
    * memory tracer: Fixed multiple race-conditions in ptrace functions attaching new threads.
    * memory_tracer: Fixed a synchronization bug in send_to_tracer function
    * Tested and validated CERE extraction on Lulesh Lawrence Livermore proto-application and on BWA gene alignment application
    * Compatibility with LLVM 3.9
    * Improved thread remapping formula for NUMA domains
    * Support for ARMv8 complete (tested on Jetson, Juno and Thunder)

[v0.2.2] 2016/06/06
    * Improved cere flag (add a stop/restart feature)
    * Fixed release version number

[v0.2.1] 2016/05/20
    * Fixed installation and replay issues from v0.2.0 (#68)
    * Cere flag exploration can be interrupted and restarted later (#69)

[v0.2.0] 2016/05/19
    * Fixed autotools installation: now CERE can and must be installed
      with make install. All libraries were renamed with a common libcere_
      prefix. (#6)
    * ccc is now called cerec (cere compiler)
    * Fixed the documentation and renamed some configuration variables.
      To set the replay repetitions now one should use CERE_REPLAY_REPETITIONS.
      To choose the warmup mode one can configure CERE_WARMUP.
    * Fixed a capture/replay bug that could happen when global static variables
      were optimized during capture but not replay. (#51)
    * Cere flags now accepts a file of flags combinations (#24)
    * Removed the undocumented and unused dump-all mode.
    * Fixed an issue with the report generation coverage plot.
    * Fixed various bugs in cere python driver.
    * Added various missing tests.

[v0.1.0] 2016/02/24
    * Compatibility with LLVM 3.5 (LLVM 3.3 and LLVM 3.4 are still
      supported).
    * Initial support for OpenMP applications. Parallel CERE (PCERE) enables
      parallel regions capture and replay. Still experimental.
      (http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1109/IPDPS.2015.19)
    * Hybrid compilation support: CERE allows experimental separate per region
      compilation, with different optimization flags.
    * CERE exploration flags support: 'CERE flag' predict region performance
      for each requested flag.
    * Reduce test suite execution runtime.

[v0.0.1] 2015/06/15
    * Initial CERE release
